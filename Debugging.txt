My Projects that I debugged

* Bank Account
Found bug in Savings for Interest Rate. When doing set Interest Rate, you could enter a negative nummber

corrected it by changing code to


public void setInterestRate(double interestRate) {
	if (InterestRate > 0) {
	InterestRate = interestRate;
	}
else{
		System.out.println("Impossible Interest");
	}
